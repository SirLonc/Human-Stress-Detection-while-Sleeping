# Human-Stress-Detection-while-Sleeping
Considering today’s lifestyle, people just sleep forgetting the benefits sleep provides to the human body.
Linear regression problem solving
What I used in the project - TensorFlow.Keras, Seaborn.



About Dataset

You will see the relationship between the parameters- snoring range of the user, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movement rate, blood oxygen levels, eye movement, number of hours of sleep, heart rate and Stress Levels (0- low/normal, 1 – medium low, 2- medium, 3-medium high, 4 -high)

About Project

I used keras perceptron with ReLU activation to train my model.Test size was 30% of whole data. After visualizing the training results, it was clear that after the 25th epoch, the model began to show an accuracy close to 100%.

Then I evaluate X_test and y_test and got 100% accuracy.
